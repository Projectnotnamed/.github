This one-month development roadmap is designed to provide a general overview of the tasks and activities involved in a condensed timeframe. Depending on the complexity of your project, you may need to adjust the schedule and allocate more or less time to specific tasks. Additionally, Agile methodologies encourage flexibility, so you can adapt the roadmap as needed to meet changing requirements and priorities.
