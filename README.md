## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Git client (e.g., GitKraken, Sourcetree) if preferred
- Git credentials with repository access

### Repository Access

Ensure you have the necessary access permissions to this repository. If you require access or encounter any issues, please contact the repository administrator or your team lead.

## Contributing

### Branching Strategy

- Create a feature branch for each task or feature you are working on.
- Use descriptive branch names, e.g., `feature/add-new-feature`.
- Do not commit directly to the main branch (e.g., `master`), create pull requests instead.

### Commit Guidelines

- Follow [commit message conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for clear and standardized commit messages.
- Keep commits small, focused, and atomic.

### Pull Requests

- Create a pull request (PR) for each branch you want to merge.
- Reference relevant issues in your PR description.
- Request reviews from team members.
- Ensure all tests pass and the code is reviewed before merging.

## Project Management

### Issue Tracking

- Use the issue tracker to report and discuss bugs, features, and tasks.
- Assign issues to team members and set priorities.
- Keep issues up-to-date with accurate labels and milestones.

### Project Boards

- Utilize project boards (e.g., Kanban, Scrum) to manage and visualize project progress.
- Move tasks through the board columns as they are in progress and completed.

## Code Review

### Code Review Process

- Code reviews are a crucial part of our development workflow.
- Reviewers should provide constructive feedback.
- Address review comments and iterate on your code before merging.

## Documentation

### Writing Documentation
